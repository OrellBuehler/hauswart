# CLAUDE.md — hauswart

hauswart is a self-hosted apartment-management app for a single household with a few users:
recurring maintenance tasks with completion tracking, documentation (markdown, uploads,
Paperless-ngx links), device inventory, defects, spare parts, contacts, costs, notifications, an
iCal feed, a guest link and an MCP server. Home Assistant, Paperless-ngx and Kept (finance) are
optional adapters, never requirements. Status: early development — authentication and the API
spine exist; the domain features are still to come.

There is one household, not many: all domain data is shared by every user. Only sessions, API
tokens, integration connections and preferences belong to a single user.

## This repository is public

- **Never commit real data.** No real names, addresses, phone numbers, Home Assistant entity ids,
  Paperless document ids, hostnames, device serial numbers or amounts from real documents in code,
  fixtures, seeds, comments or commits. Use synthetic data and `example.org` hostnames. Real data
  lives only in gitignored `seed/local/` or is entered in the UI.
- The `leak-guard` hook blocks locally configured private terms (`.private-terms`, gitignored).
  If it fires, remove the data — never weaken the hook, the gitleaks config or add a term to a
  tracked file.
- Commit messages and PR texts follow the same rules. Never mention AI tools in them.

## Commands

```bash
bun dev                  # dev server
bun run verify           # format:check + lint + check + test — run before every commit
bun run format           # prettier --write
bun run lint:fix         # eslint --fix
bun run check            # paraglide compile + svelte-kit sync + svelte-check
bun run test             # vitest (unit)
bun run test:coverage
bun run build && bun run start
bun run db:generate      # after editing src/lib/server/schema.ts
bun run openapi          # regenerate docs/openapi.json from the registry (a test fails if stale)
bun run i18n             # recompile Paraglide messages (also runs on install and in check)
bun run leak-guard --all # scan the whole tree for private terms
bun run security         # semgrep, bun audit, trivy
```

Bun only — never npm, pnpm or yarn (`bunx` for one-off tools). Hooks run via prek:
`prek install` once per clone.

## Architecture

REST-first: all domain logic sits behind a versioned JSON API under `/api/v1`. The Svelte frontend
consumes that API through a typed client — the same API the native mobile app, Home Assistant and
the MCP server use.

```

### Authentication and the API spine

- **Principals.** The hook resolves the caller into `event.locals` (`user`, `session`, `token`): the
  `hauswart_session` cookie (sha256-hashed 32-byte token, 30 days, sliding refresh), or
  `Authorization: Bearer hw_…` — bearer tokens are honoured on `/api/v1/` paths only and never fall
  back to the cookie. `resolvePrincipal` turns locals into `{auth: 'session'|'token', user, scopes}`.
  Sessions hold every scope their role allows; a token holds its scopes capped by its owner's
  current role (`admin` only for administrators).
- **Endpoint auth modes**: `session` (cookie only), `bearer` (token only), `both`, `public`.
  `scopes` lists what the caller needs (all of them; `[]` = any authenticated caller). The hook only
  turns anonymous callers away (redirect to `/login?redirectTo=…`, `/setup` while there are no
  users, a 401 envelope for `/api/*`); `bind` is the real gate and enforces mode and scopes.
- **CSRF** (in `bind`): a state-changing request authenticated by cookie — and every endpoint with
  `setsSession` (login, setup) — needs `Origin` equal to the app origin and `Content-Type:
application/json` (`multipart/form-data` for multipart endpoints), else 403 `csrf_failed`. Bearer
  requests skip it. Set `ORIGIN` behind a reverse proxy.
- **Errors** are always `{error: {code, message, details?}}` with the codes in
  `src/lib/api/errors.ts`; services throw `AuthError`-style domain errors or `ApiError`, `bind`
  maps them. Unknown errors become 500 `internal` and are logged by name and code only.
- **Rate limits**: failed password attempts (login and device-token login share one budget, per
  user + client address, per address, per user); 300 requests/min per bearer token; 30
  state-changing requests/min per client address on public endpoints. In-memory, so behind a proxy
  set `ADDRESS_HEADER`/`XFF_DEPTH`. 429 carries `Retry-After`.
- **Response validation** against the endpoint's schema runs outside production only.
- **Public paths** (`src/lib/server/auth/routing.ts`): `/login`, `/setup`, `/api/health`,
  `/api/v1/health`, `/api/v1/openapi.json`, `/api/v1/setup`, `/api/v1/auth/login`,
  `/api/v1/auth/token`, `/api/public/*`, `/g/*`. A new `public` endpoint must be added there (a
  test fails otherwise).
- Not built yet, structure kept: TOTP, passkeys and recovery codes (extend `AUTH_EVENT_TYPES`, add
  a step after `verifyCredentials` in `auth/login.ts`), self-service password change.

## Invariants

- **REST-first.** Domain logic lives in services and is reachable only through `/api/v1`. Pages
  call the typed client; no SvelteKit form actions for domain logic. A route file is a one-liner
  and the registry guard test (`src/routes/api/registry.test.ts`) enforces it.
- **Zod at every boundary**: request bodies, query strings, env, integration payloads, imported
  files. Inside a boundary trust the types. One schema serves validation, types and OpenAPI.
- **Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings in the household time zone** (`HAUSWART_TZ`); instants are
  `timestamp_ms` integers in the database and UTC ISO strings on the wire (`toIso`). Never derive a
  calendar date from `toISOString()` or the server zone; handlers get `ctx.today`.
- **Money is integer minor units** (`Minor`) plus an ISO 4217 code. Never floats. Cost splits use
  `shareOf` with `ownership_bps`.
- **One household, several users.** Domain data is shared by all users and needs no per-user
  scoping. Per-user resources (sessions, API tokens, integration connections, preferences) are
  filtered by the caller's id in the service and invisible to other users (404, never 403). Every
  endpoint is covered by the authz matrix (`src/routes/authz.test.ts`, generated from the registry):
  anonymous, wrong credential kind, missing scope, member vs administrator, cross-origin cookie
  request. No endpoint returns data the caller may not see.
- **Integrations are adapters.** Nothing outside `integrations/<name>/` knows Home Assistant,
  Paperless or Kept; entities reference external ids opaquely and work without them. Adapters are
  tested against fake servers. `src/lib/server/integrations/boundary.test.ts` fails when anything
  but `integrations/**`, `hooks.server.ts` or an allow-listed route imports from `integrations/`.
- **No swallowed errors.** No empty `catch`, no `catch { return null }` without logging and a
  user-visible outcome.
- **Never log PII**: names, addresses, contact details, document contents, tokens.
- **Every UI string goes through Paraglide**; add the key to `messages/de.json` and
  `messages/en.json` together (a test enforces identical key sets). German is the base locale.
- **Migrations**: edit `schema.ts`, run `bun run db:generate`, commit the generated file. Never
  edit an existing migration, never use `drizzle-kit push`.

## Svelte 5 and UI

Runes only: `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`, `{@render children()}`. No `export let`,
no `$:`, no `<slot />`, no stores for component state. Tailwind classes with `cn()` from
`$lib/utils`; no component CSS. Use shadcn-svelte components. Pages must work at 360 px width and
in dark mode. Every list has an empty state, every async action a pending and an error state.

## Testing

- Unit tests sit next to the code (`foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts`); database tests use `useTestDB()`.
- Route tests call the real handler through the real hook with `callRoute(GET, { session | bearer,
json, origin, … })` from `$lib/testing/route`; users and tokens come from `createTestUser`,
  `loginTestUser` and `createTestToken`. Rate limiters are reset before every test.
- Engine tests are table-driven with an injected `today`/`now` — never read the clock inside the
  engine.
- Bug fixes start with a failing test.
- Fixtures are synthetic and live in `src/lib/testing/fixtures/`.

## Subagents (`.claude/agents/`)

| Agent         | Scope                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `backend`     | schema, migrations, services, task engine, API schemas/registry/routes, authz tests   |
| `frontend`    | Svelte pages and components on top of the typed client, i18n strings, responsive UI   |
| `integration` | Home Assistant / Paperless / Kept adapters with fake servers; keeps the boundary rule |
| `reviewer`    | read-only review of a change against these invariants, leak, i18n and authz checks    |
| `researcher`  | read-only research on external systems and libraries, cited report                    |

Workflow: backend first (with tests and the API contract), then frontend against that contract,
integration work in parallel where it is independent, then `reviewer`. Skills in
`.claude/skills/`: `new-endpoint`, `new-table`, `new-trigger`, `verify`.

## Git

Conventional commits, lowercase (`feat: add task engine`, `fix: …`, `refactor:`, `chore:`,
`docs:`, `test:`, `ci:`). Run `bun run verify` before committing. Never commit `.private-terms`,
`.env`, `data/` or `seed/local/`.
